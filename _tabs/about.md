## Work
Co-Founder of [Calibir](https://calibir.com).

Infosec and marketing are my drink of choice.

## Brick & Mortar Education

Went to Auburn University, studied philosophy, and worked as a student manager for the men's basketball team.

## Motivations

In undergrad I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity with a nationally renowned athletic department that opened my eyes to the business of college athletics, and college as a whole. Affording me the opportunity to see first-hand, something with little reputation, be built into a globally recognized powerhouse in its respective sector. 

The experience exposed me to things a classroom never could. It allowed me to see inefficiencies that affect both individual and industry. This experience is why I decided to co-found [Calibir](https://calibir.com) with Matt and Devin. These inefficiencies are an opportunity for a solution, one that respects both individual and industry.
