# Life After Google - The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchcain Economy | George Gilder

## Thoughts

The idea of life after google is that currently we operate on googles system of the world, and that there are technologies that can move us past this. To be clear, Gilder gives google the praise it is worthy of. The creation of arguably the worlds greatest money machine, its ad-based search engine that has birthed this system of the world.

He takes this term from Neil Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, where it is used to denote a set of ideas that pervade a society's technology and institutions and inform its civilization. Gilder does an incredible job taking you through the mathematical history of what makes this system possible.

The information economy is still spoken about as if it is a new thing. However, Gilder shows the reader that the math has been here for decades, and it was google who consumated it all. From the likes of Isaac Newton, Kurt GÃ¶del, Alan Turing, Gregory Chaitin, William Briggs, John von Neuman, Hubert Yockey, Claude Shannon, Peter Drucker, and Ludwig Boltzmann came googles system of the world. Sometimes referred to as the informaiton economy or the oligopoly of Brin and Page.

>Google's idea of progress stems from its technological vision. Newton and his fellows, inspired by their Judeo-Christian world view, unleashed a theory of prgoess with human creativity and free will at its core. If the path of knowledge is the infinetly fast processing of all data, if the mind - that engine by which we pursue the truth of things - is simply a logic machine, then the combination of data and algorithm can produce one and only one result. Such a vision is not only determinisitc but ulitmately dictatorial. If there is a moral imperative to pursue the truth, and the truth can be found only by centralized processing of all the data in the world, then all the data in the world must, by the moral order implied, be gathered into one fold with one shepard. Google may talke a good game about privacy, but private data are the mortal enemy of its system of the world.

The walk through of how google came to be the force they are was very well done. I enjoyed how detailed gilder was in their compilation of minds to tackle problems at all levels of the [OSI model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OSI_model). From understanding the way light moves through fiber optic calbes, to testing underwater data centers for cooling purposes, to using machine learning that moves "search" to "suggest," the reader is provided insight into how google has some of the brightest minds working at each level. 

### So where does the life _after_ google come into play?

The book does focus on google predominantly, but also mentions the likes of facebook, amazon, and apple as participants in the same manners and methods Gilder details with google. It is worth noting that emphasis he places on blockchain and its potential is not some maximalist view. This is the same author whom in 1990 published _Life after Television_ where he predicted the personal computer at the time would become the smartphones we see today at a first principle level. The same author whom in 200 published _Telecosm_ that predicted the fibre optic comm infra to scale where costs would reach practically zero. Gilder is a widley respected mind when it comes to forcasting technology.

His tone surrounding blockchain and cryptography is one of reason with a hint of revolt. I will say the last 3 chapters of the book did fall of comapred to others. It was published in 2018 so the narrative surrounding the space was greatly allure and grandiose visionaries. However, what amazing movement starts without such a thing? I'm very curious to see what he has to say about the time passed since the publishment of the book.
